# Real_estate_price_prediction.
 This Flask app predicts house prices using a RandomForestRegressor model trained on a housing dataset. It includes data pre-processing with pipelines and imputers, stratified train-test splitting, and a user input form. Predictions are displayed on the web page, making it ideal for learning basic machine learning deployment with Flask.
